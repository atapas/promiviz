**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It was not a problem actually but it looking very basic and plain just like default designing. By putting some efforts it can be done nicely that's what I have improved.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
By using CSS I've removed the default border of the select box using your class/ID or element and the post click border which was looking really irritating. And by using the hover effect I've and some light background and a slim border to the select boxes.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The other options may be are one can change the font style and the pattern of dropdown menu. Dropdown menu should show some transition after and before opening.

**Additional context**
I've made changes from line 83 to 93 and 148 to 161.



Thank you.
