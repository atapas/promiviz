`PromiViz` is an opensource tool to visualize the JavaScript Promise APIs. It is a playground for developers to configure promises with delays, resolve/reject, and more.

# 🚀 Demo
Here is a quick demo of the app. I hope you enjoy it.

# 🔥 Features
`PromiViz` comes with a bundle of features already. You can do the followings with it,

- Schedule a promise to resolve/reject after a delay
- Reject a promise specifically.
- Run and test all the Promise APIs, `all`, `any`, `allSettled`, `rece`, `resolve`, `reject`.
- Shows logs of the execution of the promises. The log includes time, text, and emojis to indicate the status of the promise.
- Ability to retain the logs for a session.
- Ability to clear the logs.
- Ability to set themes.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly.
- It is a PWA(Progressive Web App)

# How is it useful to you?
JavaScript promises are a bit complex topic to understand for the beginners. However, your interviewers will love to ask quiestions from this topic. Hence an in-deepth understanding
of how it works internally would be a great advantage.

`PromiViz` will help you with that. You can run the promises, customize them, and see the execution
logs to understand what's happening. You can also modify the settings, try diferent combinations of 
the APIs, resolve/reject to firm up your understanding.

# 🦄 What are the future enhencements?
Here are some of the future enhencements planned:
- Schedule a promise to resolve/reject after a delay with a custom message.
- Ability to add more promises(beyond the three out-of-the boxes).
- Ability to run customized examples from the app.
- Ability to run the promises in a loop to showcase the loop related use-cases.
- Persist a history of promise runs.
- Persisit logs across sessions.
- More themes.
# 🍔 Built With
Well, I built this app with the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAvaScript

True, No React, Angular, Vue, yet. As it was done as an initial prototype, I may move the app to a framework later.

# 🏗️ How to Set up `PromiViz` for Development?
- Clone the repository.
- Browse to the project directory.
- Just run the `index.html` file with any server of your choice. You can use, `npx serve` or if you
are using `VS Code`, you can use the `Live Server` extention to run it.
