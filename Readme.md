`PromiViz` is an open-source tool to visualize the JavaScript Promise APIs. It is a playground for developers to configure promises with delays, resolve/reject, and more.

# 🔥 Features
`PromiViz` comes with a bundle of features already. You can do the following with it:
- Schedule a promise to resolve/reject after a delay.
- Reject a promise specifically.
- Run and test all the Promise APIs, `all`, `any`, `allSettled`, `race`, `resolve`, `reject`.
- Show logs of the execution of the promises. The log includes time, text, and emojis to indicate the status of the promise.
- Ability to retain the logs for a session.
- Ability to clear the logs.
- Ability to set themes.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly.
- It is a PWA(Progressive Web App).


# How is it helpful to you?
JavaScript promises are a bit of a complex topic to understand for beginners. However your interviewers will love to ask questions about this topic. Hence an in-depth understanding
of how it works internally would be a great advantage.
`PromiViz` will help you with that. You can run the promises, customize them, and see the execution
logs to understand what's happening. You can also modify the settings, try different combinations of the APIs, resolve/reject to firm up your understanding.


# 🦄 What are the future enhancements?
Here are some of the future enhancements planned:
- Schedule a promise to resolve/reject after a delay with a custom message.
- Ability to add more promises (beyond the three out-of-the-boxes).
- Ability to run customized examples from the app.
- Ability to run the promises in a loop to showcase the loop-related use-cases.
- Persist a history of promise runs.
- Persist logs across sessions.
- More themes.


# 🍔 Built With
I built this app with the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- (Plain New) JavaScript
True, No React, Angular, Vue, yet. As it was done as an initial prototype, I may move the app to a framework later.


# 🏗️ How to Set up `PromiViz` for Development?
- Clone the repository.
- Browse to the project directory.
- Just run the `index.html` file with any server of your choice. You can use `npx serve`, or if you
are using `VS Code`, you can use the `Live Server` extension to run it.
